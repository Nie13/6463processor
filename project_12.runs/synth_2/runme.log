|Module Name    | RTL Object               | Inference | Size (Depth x Width) | Primitives                   | 
+---------------+--------------------------+-----------+----------------------+------------------------------+
|rc5totalDesign | instrmemory/data_mem_reg | Implied   | 512 x 32             | RAM64X1D x 10  RAM64M x 50   | 
+---------------+--------------------------+-----------+----------------------+------------------------------+

Note: The table above is a preliminary report that shows the Distributed RAMs at the current stage of the synthesis flow. Some Distributed RAMs may be reimplemented as non Distributed RAM primitives later in the synthesis flow. Multiple instantiated RAMs are reported only once.
